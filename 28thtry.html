<h1> 81 Times People Said Something So Stupid,Their Dates Were At A Loss For Words</h1>
<p>One minute you're gazing lovingly into their eyes, the next you're thinking "Wait... What?"
     The person in front of you has just hurtled from the pedestal you put them on to the pit of pathetic.
      The reality hits like a tone of bricks: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=im+an+idiot">"I'm dating an idiot."</a> 
</p>

    Maybe it's because they thought tuna is made from chicken, or that Africa is a country.
     Perhaps their hidden racist, misogynistic or selfish side finally popped out from behind the mask they've been wearing so well until now.
      Whatever the reason, there's no turning back.
       Your not-so-better half has revealed that they're not the sharpest tool in the shed, a few fries short of a Happy Meal, and they are certainly not playing with a full deck of cards.
        The lights are on but no-one's home.

Someone recently asked, <strong>"At what moment did you realize you were dating an idiot?"</strong> and some of the answers are nothing short of pure, glorious stupidity.
 <strong>Bored Panda </strong>has put together a list of the funniest, most cringe and downright sad responses.
  From confusing simple geography to misunderstanding how basic objects work, the stories range from harmlessly goofy to "what in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=red+flag">the red flag?</a>" levels of alarming.
 Many prove that today's dating pool is indeed awash with dimwits.
